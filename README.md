# AirBnB bookings in Rio de Janeiro for 2016 

## BrainStation Final Project for Data analytics course (2023)

### Prompt scenario
You are the first data scientist to join a cross-functional Product and Operations team working to grow bookings in Rio de Janeiro. The team asks you for help with the following:

-What key metrics would you propose to monitor over time the success of the team's efforts in improving the guest host matching process and why? Clearly define your metric(s) and explain how each is computed.

-What areas should we invest in to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro? What segments are doing well and what could be improved? ​ ​Propose 2-3 specific recommendations (business initiatives and product changes) that could address these opportunities. Demonstrate rationale behind each recommendation AND prioritize your recommendations in order of their estimated impact.

-There is also interest from executives at Airbnb in the work you are doing, and a desire to understand the broader framing of the challenge of matching supply and demand, thinking beyond the data provided. What other research, experiments, or approaches could help the company get more clarity on the problem?
